          Portal is wrapper component for ReactDOM.createPortal API. Render any component or element at the end of
          document.body or at given element. Modal and Drawer components are wrapped in Portal by default.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use Portal to render component or element at different place (defaults to the end of document.body). Portal is
          useful when you want to prevent parent styles from interfering with child, usually all these styles are
          related to position and z-index properties and portals are used for components with fixed position, for
          example, modals.
